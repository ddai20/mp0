      <p> I am a junior at UIUC on track to completing a dual degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I enjoy learning about complex/creative ideas and finding ways to apply them in the real world. I believe that Computer Science can be a tool used to promote creativity and productivity. Whether it's building a building an application or applying data analysis, I aim to work on projects that create a positive impact on people's lives. </p>
      <p> I have been a part of many RSOs such as Illini VEXU, Illini Data Science, and ACM GameBuilders. I will graduate from UIUC in May 2027. </p>
